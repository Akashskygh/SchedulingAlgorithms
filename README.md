This Python script contains functions for different CPU scheduling algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin. These functions prompt users for process details like arrival time, burst time, and priority and then calculate the average waiting time and execution sequence based on the chosen scheduling algorithm.
